Hi, there! Iâ€™m a master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree at Xidian University, under supervision of Prof. [Hui Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/lihui/index.html) in June 2023. 

My research interest span system security and software engineering.
Specifically, I focus on developing impactful, real-world solutions for detecting and defending against vulnerabilities in a wide range of systems, including Open-Source Software Supply Chains, Cross-Platform Endpoints, and LLM Infrastructures.

- OSS Security: NPM/PyPI code poisoning (ASE'23, ASE'24)
- Endpoint Security: ransomware (CCS'24), miniapp security (ASE'23) & privacy (TOSEM, SaTS'23)
- LLM Infra Security: pre-trained model supply chain (TOSEM, ASE'24)

If you would like to reach me, please send an email to [shenaowang AT hust.edu.cn](mailto:shenaowang@hust.edu.cn)
